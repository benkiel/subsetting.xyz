    <h2>Which type foundries support font subsetting?</h2>
    <p>
      Subsetting is the process of removing characters from a font to reduce its
      file size. Fonts often include letters and symbols for multiple languages.
      While removing unused characters from a font can substantially improve
      performance,
      <strong
        >many type foundries have restrictive licenses that prevent editing font
        files</strong
      >. Use this site to find type foundries that support font subsetting.

    <h3>Q&A</h3>
    <h4>How do I subset fonts?</h4>
    <p>We recommend using the library <a href="https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger">glyphhanger</a>. This <a href="https://florianbrinkmann.com/en/glyphhanger-4691/">tutorial</a> by Florian Brinkmann provides helpful step-by-step instructions.
    <h4>How big of a difference does it make?</h4>
    <p>
      The change in file size depends on how many characters you remove. When I’ve created a subset for English, a <strong>reduction from 45KB to 15KB per font</strong> has been typical.
    </p>
    <h4>Is there a downside?</h4>
    <p>
      There are a few pitfalls with subsetting that are hard to spot. First, subsetting can remove kerning or OpenType features; we haven't had that experience with <a href="https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger">glyphhanger</a>, but it has happened with other tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, subsetting can cause weirdness with website translation tools. If you create a subset with only English characters and a visitor uses Google Translate to read in Spanish, the letter E will use your custom typeface while the letter É will use the fallback. The solution: create multiple subsets—one for the primary language, and one for additional characters. You can use the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/u/unicode-range/">unicode-range</a> property to tell the browser which subset(s) to load.
    </p>
    <h4>Does Google Fonts support subsetting?</h4>
    <p>
      Google Fonts sources from multiple foundries, and licenses vary. Most use
      the <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL">Open Font License</a>, which supports subsetting.
